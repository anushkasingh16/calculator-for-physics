# calculator-for-physics
A calculator for topics in Physics, ranging from equations of motion, projectile motion, etc built with Python.

# Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository containing main.py through the terminal.
3. In the terminal, run the following command (this assumes that you already have python 3 installed on your local machine):
    python3 main.py

# Future Plans
Rather than asking the user to fill in each value, having a function in place that takes in a whole physics problem and can isolate the given values and what the question requires us to find.
